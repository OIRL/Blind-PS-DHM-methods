## Blind-PS-DHM-methods
### Fast, automatic and accurate methods 

We present two blind-iterative phase-shifting algorithms in which there is no need of prior knowledge of the phase shifts between the raw holograms. These two approaches provide accurate quantitative phase images in Phase-Shifting Digital Holographic Microscopy (PS-DHM) using  three or two raw holograms. The proposed methods are based on the demodulation of the spectral components of the recorded holograms. The hallmarks of our methods are blindness (no prior knowledge of any phase shift), accuracy, and reduced acquisition and processing times leading to a PS-DHM system more suitable for dynamic imaging, as is the case of live cell imaging and colloidal systems


### Blind three raw holograms

This method uses three raw holograms with arbitrary phase-shift. The only requirement of this approach is that the PS-DHM system should operate in slightly off-axis regime with an overlay between the different spectral orders up to 80%. Thus, the Fourier components of the real and virtual images (e.g., +1 and -1 terms) can be partially overlapped.

### Blind two raw holograms

This method uses two raw holograms with arbitrary phase-shift. Since in this implementation we only uses two holograms, there is a 33% reduction  in both the acquisition and computational time  compared with the previous blind three-frame PS-DHM algorithms. The advantage of the reduced acquisition and processing times leads to a PS-DHM system more suitable for dynamic imaging. However, the requirement of this approach is that the PS-DHM system should operate in slightly off-axis regime without overlapping of the spectra of the ±1 terms.
